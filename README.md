## Creating 3D Object using WebGL

**Object** : 2 Spheres (big & small)

**Feature** : texture, translation, rotation, scale, animation (click)
 
**Note** : `translation`, `rotation` and `scale` controls will be **applied** and **visible** when you click *"Start Animation"*

*Thank you for visiting my repository, I really hope for a response from you!*
